# Effect-of-solar-wind-on-satellite-motion

Assume that a satellite orbiting Earth is affected not only by the Earth's gravitational force, but also by a weak uniform (constant in magnitude and direction) "solar wind" of magnitude W acting in a horizontal direction. Choose initial conditions so that a circular orbit would be obtained for W=0. Then chose a value of W/m whose magnitude is about 1% of the acceleration due to gravitational field for the circular orbit
Before doing computer simulations give reasons for anticipated satellite trajectory
Optional. Consider W=0 when the Earth blocks the solar wind, i.e. if the satellite is in the Earth's shadow.

Calculate a trajectory of the satellite affected by the solar wind. Compare your anticipated trajectory with results of your computer simulations.
How does the total energy and total angular momentum change?
What if the exponent in the central-force law is changed from -2 to -1.9?
Optional: What if the initial conditions were such that the unperturbed orbit was a fairly long ellipse lying along the horizontal axis. What motion would occur?
Optional: Suppose W were turned on slowly, from zero to its full value in the space of several orbits. Would that change the effect very much?
